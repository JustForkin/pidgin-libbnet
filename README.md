# Classic Battle.net Plugin for Pidgin

Introduction
============

This plugin allows you to connect to Battle.net with Pidgin in order to chat.

Battle.net is the Blizzard Entertainment gaming service that connects WarCraft? II, StarCraft?, Diablo II, WarCraft? III (and other) games on a single chatting, stats-saving, and matchmaking system.

This plugin provides chat features only and will not under any circumstance join games or alter the in-game experience for any of the above games. It requires that you own the game you are chatting as (by requiring a CD key for that game).

This plugin requires that you specify an external 3rd-party "Logon Server" (otherwise known as BNLS for Battle.net Logon Server) that emulates the version checking process, and does not require any additional local files.
